  <h1>Blazor Graduation Project</h1>
  <h2>Made an Blazor WebbAssembly project with an ASP.NET CORE WebbAPI for beginners playing World Of Warcraft.</h2>
  <p>In this project you can in depth get an easy picture about the game world of warcraft in a kinda basic way, u are able to list up all the characterraces in the game with different factions with the use of the API</p>
  <p>You can also see which classes that are playable for every characterrace in each faction, all this u can do while looking into more details in the character screen with more indepth detailed information, all of this is also fetched from the API.</p>
