    <h3>Beginner Friendly Classes</h3>
    <p>
        The easiest classes/specs to play are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beast Mastery Hunter</strong> – Easy damage rotation with few buttons.</li>
        <li><strong>Retribution Paladin</strong> – Simple and straightforward damage rotation.</li>
        <li><strong>Fury Warrior</strong> – Fast-paced but easy to remember rotation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hardest DPS to Play</h3>
    <p>
        These classes have complicated rotations with multiple DoTs (damage over time) to track:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shadow Priest</strong> - Hard uptime when it comes to damage also pretty messy rotation with DOT managment.</li>
        <li><strong>Elemental Shaman</strong>- Very good class and spec but pretty hard for beginners, need tracking off alot of buffs and dots which will make the damage uptime pretty miserable if not done correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Subtlety Rogue</strong> - At the momement the worst performing specialization/class of them all when it comes to live logs of players playing around the world which makes it also kinda unrewarding playing it, also has like 11-12 button rotation which is kinda hard to memorize as a beginner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Easiest Healers for Beginners</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restoration Shaman</strong> - Pretty beginner friendly healer with great healing output with all their healing spells, have alot of big cooldowns which can save u in scenarios when u need big output healing fast shaman is the healing class to pick!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hardest Healer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Restoration Druid</strong> - Alot of similarties to the hardest damage classes/specs, here u need to have a good tracking of something called HOTS (Healing over time) instead which as the damage classes is pretty hard for a beginner to learn from scratch, it takes practice and time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Easiest Tanks to Play</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protection Warrior</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Blood Death Knight</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hardest Tank to Play</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Brewmaster Monk</strong> is hard due to low survivability. You need to be skilled at generating HP and managing damage output, which is low compared to other tanks, making it tough for beginners.

    <h3>Best Zones for Leveling</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Dragon Isles</strong> is currently the best zone for leveling thanks to a 20% experience boost when playing Dragonflight content.
        <br />
        <strong>Broken Isles</strong> also gives the same experience boost and is a good alternative.

    <h3>Race Tips</h3>
    <p>
        Don’t overthink your race choice for your class. Pick a race that you think looks cool and has a lore you like.
        All races have unique racial abilities, but for beginners it’s more important to enjoy how your character looks and feels while playing.
